# Romantic Era of Music (1820-1990)
<!-- Version 1.0 -->
Week 1:
1. The central theme of my dataset will be the Romantic Era of music, 1820-1900. This includes composers such as Debussy, Chopin, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Brahms, and Berlioz, as well as some Irish and Scottish romantic composers.
2. Based on my own experience, some of the challenges that come with working with music from two centuries ago is being able to confirm the accuracy of the music available. Many well-known works have several versions, some that have been edited and some that have been restored from partial or lost scores. This music is easily accessible due to the number of versions available, but this can make it difficult to choose the "right" one, whether you're prioritizing simplicity, accuracy, or something else. This also leads to people generally being able to accept different versions of the same music. People typically work with these old music types through scores, original or edited, and recordings, performed or original if available. Working with music in general can be difficult due to the different data offered for different music, with some more complex music losing detail or not being compatible with other types of music. Since there will be no new music of this period, we are left to work with the pieces that are left and our interpretations of them, which can lose precision over time.
