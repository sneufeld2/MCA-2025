    <p>This data provides significant insights into the statistics of every aspect of the piece. Since I know the piece is in E major, it makes sense that the mean pitch and the most common
    pitch class are G# and B, which are both in the E major chord (even though E would usually be the most common, this particular segment of this piece clearly doesn't have the root note as
    the most common note). Even if I didn't know which key the piece was in, I would be able to guess by looking at the most common pitches and pitch classes. The difference between these is
    that pitch classes includes enharmonically equivalent notes (e.g. G# and Ab) as well as the same note in different octaves. I also found the melodic motion statistics interesting, because
    looking at the sheet music itself, you can observe that it consists of a lot of intervals of a perfect 4th (B to E), so it makes sense to see this in the analysis of having 43.59% of the
    melodic intervals being perfect fourths. </p>
