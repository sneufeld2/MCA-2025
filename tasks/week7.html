    <h1>Week 7: Waltz no. 15 in E Major B.44</h1>
    <h3>Adding Genre and Copyright Information to MEI Metadata</h2>
    <p>
      When adding genre, I added it to the notesStmt section under the work section. I decided to also add period and style, because these are further subclassifications especially for
      the classical genre of music that my portfolio is focused on. Next, I decided to use CC0 1.0 because the song itself is from 1894, so it's public domain. I didn't add any originality 
      to the work; I simply encoded the existing data into a more easily-readable file. Users are allowed to share for any use without permission or requirement to attribute me (even 
      though it can still be preferred).
    </p>
    <h3>Update MEI File</h3>
    <p>After incorporating these elements into my Valse.mei file from week 3, here is the new updated file:
