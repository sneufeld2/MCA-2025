    <h1>Week 10</h1>
    <h2>Three Classical Audio Tracks - Similarity Matrices</h2>
    <p>These graphs use 10 audio tracks, the first 7 provided by the instructor. Tracks 0-3 are classical and 4-6 are rock. The next three tracks are the same as the past two weeks; track 7 is
      the Prelude, track 8 is the Sonata, and track 9 is the Symphony. As expected, these three groupings are clear in the graphs. Since my tracks are also classical/piano tracks, they also
      show to be very similar to the first four tracks.

  <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>Since these are all piano pieces, the MFCC graphs between the songs are very similar, with only a few minor differences. For the spectrogram histograms, they are also similar, as expected,
    with the Symphony having consistently lower values. The main graph type I'd like to look deeper into is the chromogram. By looking at the x-axes, you can take note of which notes
    appear the most often in these songs: C, D, and Eb in the Prelude; D, F#, and A in the Sonata; and Bb, F, Eb, and C for the Symphony. The first two match with their keys, but 
    the last graph is interesting, because the song is in D major, as the title suggests. This may suggest modulation. The main focus, however, is on how these graphs compare
    to each other; there is the most volume on the Prelude histogram and the least on the Symphony one. This can help determine the variety of notes present in the song. The Sonata
    histogram went up to 0.05, which is the highest that any of the graphs go on the x axis, suggesting a strong presence of the particular pitch, which in this case is D.</p>
