    <p class="reflection">
      Transcribing in MuseScore was highly intuitive and easy to do. I chose a romantic-era waltz composed by Frédéric Chopin (click link above). <br>
      Adding the note values and duration was very simple once I learned the order to push the buttons. I figured out keyboard shortcuts which made workflow much easier and quicker.
      A couple problems came up that I could directly solve within the software; for example, adding a grace note wasn't an option on the
      default palettes, but I could search and find the tool easily. I had to Google search a couple problems I had, such as changing the notes that are tied when adding a tie. I found the keyboard
      shortcut that changes the second note, but it still wouldn't connect to the correct note of the chord. I eventually solved this problem after having to deal with having two voices on the same
      staff. I anticipated this being much more complicated, but MuseScore actually has a Voice 1/Voice 2 control button where you can very easily add another voice, which occurs later in this
      excerpt, which ended up being fairly intuitive. I was able to use this feature on specific notes of the chords in the first few measures to ensure the ties were to the top notes and not the
      bottom notes. <br>
      I also had to look up how to change the first measure to a pick-up bar with only one beat, but this also ended up being simple. I figured out how to add fingering numbers, with
      the only somewhat annoying thing being having to click each note every time I wanted to add a number. There might be a way around this, but it felt time-consuming. <br>
      I am sure there are many more keyboard shortcuts I am not aware of, which I would like to learn to improve workflow even more. I appreciate having these shortcuts because I work much more 
      quickly on the keyboard. <br>
      Finally, it is very easy in the program to edit each specific element and move them around to where is best fit; they're not "stuck" to wherever the program places them. Overall, other than
      the few problems I had to search up (and found the answers very quickly), using MuseScore was a highly intuitive experience and I can tell it has a wide range of features suitable for 
      creating almost any type of music.
      This week’s project features a beautiful romantic-era waltz composed by Frédéric Chopin. The piece showcases elegant phrasing and expressive harmony, perfect for exploring musical structure and notation. I found it fascinating to analyze the rhythmic flow and how Chopin uses subtle dynamics to evoke emotion. It deepened my appreciation for classical composition and the nuances of music
